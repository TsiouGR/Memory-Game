### How To Play?

You can download or clone the repo and run the `index.html` file on your local system.

Alternatively you can **[Play Here!](https://tsiougr.github.io/Memory-Game/)**

You are given 8 pairs of cards (Mario themed).

You will need to pair the cards that are the same by revealing two cards at the time. If the cards match, they will stay turned and you can proceed to the next cards. If the cards don't match they will be folded back again and you will have to try to remember the pictures behind them to match them with subsequent cards.
You can reset your game anytime and start again.
Good luck and have fun!

### Score

Every time you reveal 2 cards, 1 move is counted. Your current number of moves is displayed above the game board at all times.

Together with the number of moves your performance is graded with stars. You start with 3 stars, if you finish the game in under 15 moves, you will be awarded 3 stars, if you finish the game between 15 and 30 moves you will be awarded 2 stars and if you take more than 25 moves to win the game you will be awarded 1 star.
